Final Project for B321: Database Management Systems 1
 
   * This was a team based project where I collaborated with a classmate.
   
   * Lucid Chart was used to create the Entity Relationship Diagram.
   * All SQL code used in this project follows SSMS syntax.
   * All tables and data were derived from a real world registrar data dump provided by USCB.
   
   * To run this code you will either have to use SSMS or another Microsoft Database application,
     or translate the syntax to the appropriate database application you are using.
