Final Project for B321: Database Management Systems 1.
 
-- This was a team based project where I collaborated with a classmate.

-- Lucid Chart was used to create the Entity Relationship Diagram.
-- All SQL code used in this project follows SSMS syntax.
-- All tables and data were derived from a real world registrar data dump provided by USCB.

-- To run this code you will either have to use SSMS or another Microsoft Databsing application,
-- or translate the syntax to the appropriate databsing application you are using.
